- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

It's like passing objects around! Like everything is in its own little bubble, and it impacts your code because you need to think even more about how Classes interact with each other. I would think in other projects, particularly public ones, it would help with ecurity and preventing objects that shouldn't be accessing certain methods or attributes from doing so. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Honestly trying to pass attributes and create the constructors was weirdly a hurdle for me. Not sure what happened, but I think the amount of ArrayLists and other datatypes caused some confusion. So I would give the advice to familiarize yourself with these datatypes and ArrayList documentation, since I've used ArrayLists before, but not in class objects outside of main() before, not belonging to individual objects.

Trying to get each object to have a new instance of other objects attributed to them is my main struggle. 



***I don't know why, but this project really psyched me out and I really doubted myself. I hope to work with feedback and try my best to push through the rest to the best of my ability. I have a feeling like I do/should know but I just wasn't able to execute it. I am really sorry I don't know why this happened.**
